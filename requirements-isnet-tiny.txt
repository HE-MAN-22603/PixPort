# Ultra-Lightweight Background Removal Service Requirements
# Optimized for Railway 512MB deployment - uses ONLY isnet-general-tiny

# Core web framework
Flask>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

# Image processing - essential for PIL/Pillow operations
Pillow>=9.0.0,<11.0.0

# ONNX Runtime - CPU only for memory efficiency
onnxruntime>=1.15.0,<1.17.0

# NumPy - required for array operations (dependency of onnxruntime anyway)
numpy>=1.21.0,<1.26.0

# System monitoring (optional but helpful for Railway)
psutil>=5.8.0,<6.0.0

# Optional: rembg for model access (can be removed if model is pre-downloaded)
# rembg>=2.0.50,<3.0.0

# Development/debugging (remove for production to save space)
# Werkzeug>=2.0.0  # Already included with Flask

# Note: CUDA/GPU dependencies are intentionally excluded for Railway deployment
# Note: Other ML libraries like torch, tensorflow are intentionally excluded
# Note: This keeps the container size and memory usage minimal

# Total estimated memory usage:
# - Base Python runtime: ~50MB  
# - Flask + dependencies: ~20MB
# - ONNX Runtime CPU: ~40MB
# - ISNet model: ~40MB
# - PIL/Pillow: ~15MB
# - NumPy: ~20MB
# - Working memory for processing: ~50MB
# = Total: ~235MB (well under Railway's 512MB limit)
