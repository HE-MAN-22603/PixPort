## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Verification

Run this command to verify everything works:
```bash
python simple_test.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Flask app factory imported
✅ Flask app created successfully!  
✅ All routes return 200 status
✅ All AI libraries imported
🎉 All tests passed!
```

## 📋 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure PixPort for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your PixPort repository
5. Wait for automatic deployment (3-5 minutes)

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard → Variables tab:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
FLASK_ENV=production
REMBG_MODEL=u2net
```

### 4. Generate Domain
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Click "Generate Domain" 
3. Get your `.railway.app` URL

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Testing

Test these URLs after deployment:
- [ ] `https://your-app.railway.app/` - Home page
- [ ] `https://your-app.railway.app/health` - Health check
- [ ] `https://your-app.railway.app/status` - Status endpoint
- [ ] `https://your-app.railway.app/ping` - Ping test

Expected responses:
- Home: HTML page with upload interface
- Health: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "PixPort", "version": "1.0.0"}`
- Status: JSON with folder status and config
- Ping: `{"message": "pong"}`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- [ ] Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Verify all files are committed to Git
- [ ] Ensure Python version matches `runtime.txt`

### Runtime Issues  
- [ ] Check deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set
- [ ] Test health endpoints
- [ ] Check memory usage (AI models need 1GB+)

### File Upload Issues
- [ ] Test with small image file
- [ ] Check `/tmp` directory permissions
- [ ] Verify static file routes work

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Response times (should be < 5 seconds for AI processing)
- [ ] Memory usage (expect 500MB-1GB with AI models)
- [ ] Error rates in logs
- [ ] Health check endpoints

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Home page loads with CSS/JS working
- [ ] File upload works without errors
- [ ] AI background removal processes test image
- [ ] Downloads work correctly
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

Your PixPort app is fully configured for Railway deployment. All Railway-specific optimizations are in place:

- **File Storage**: Uses `/tmp` for Railway ephemeral storage
- **Static Serving**: Custom routes for uploaded/processed files  
- **AI Models**: Downloaded during build process
- **Environment**: Detects Railway automatically
- **Logging**: Production-ready logging configuration
- **Health Checks**: Endpoints for Railway monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures

**Deploy with confidence!** 🚀
